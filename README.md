This script uses winget in background to update your apps. Learn more: https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli
Also windows defender might pop up because it is new (I guess) so click on "more info" and then "run anyway" to bypass it. Also don't worry it's safe because I have very less code and I am really not the best at scripting or coding ðŸ¤£.

How to run it:
- Download the whole repo here: https://github.com/themoonmeetsthesun/app-updater/archive/refs/heads/master.zip
- Extract it
- Go inside that folder
- Double click on update.bat
