This script uses winget in background to update your apps. Learn more: https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli
Also windows defender might pop up because it is new (I guess) so click on "more info" and then "run anyway" to bypass it. Also don't worry it's safe because I have very less code and I am really not the best at scripting or coding ğŸ¤£.

To run it:

- run: curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/themoonmeetsthesun/app-updater/master/appupdater.bat > appupdater.bat
- run: start "appupdater.bat"
- CMD defaults to the user folder so you can find it there. If you started this command in another folder you can find it there if you want to run it next time.
